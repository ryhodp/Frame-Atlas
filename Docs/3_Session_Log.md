# Reference Library — Session Log
*Updated after each build day. Source of truth for where we are and what's next.*

---

## How This Works

After each build session, a new entry is added to this log capturing:
- **What we built** — features completed, decisions made
- **Deferred** — things planned for the day that got pushed, with reason
- **Up next** — exact starting point for the next session

At the start of any new session, say: *"I'm ready for Day X"* — this log tells Claude exactly where we are.

## Day 0 — Account Setup
*Status: COMPLETE*

- [x] GitHub repo created
- [x] Railway account + project connected to repo
- [x] Google Cloud: Drive API enabled, service account created, JSON downloaded
- [x] Google AI Studio: Gemini API key generated

---

## Day 1 — Skeleton Deploy
*Completed: June 26, 2026*

See Day 2 log for full details. App scaffolded and deployed to Railway.

## Day 2 — Google Drive Sync Pipeline
*Completed: June 26, 2026*

### What We Built
- Flask backend with sync worker, thumbnail generation, SQLite storage
- SyncManager.jsx frontend component with progress bar and error reporting
- Google Drive service account set up and shared with Inspiration Images folder

### The Blocker Left Over
Railway environment variable injection was failing — `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS` was set in Railway UI but not reaching the Flask app. Left for Day 3.

---

## Day 3 — Infrastructure Fix + Image Grid
*Completed: June 26, 2026*

### What We Built
- ✅ Fixed Railway port mismatch — domain was pointed at port 5000, app runs on 8080. Changed to 8080 in Settings → Networking.
- ✅ Fixed `GOOGLE_DRIVE_CREDENTIALS` env var — the JSON was being truncated when pasted (only `{` was reaching the app). Fixed by generating a fresh single-line JSON via `cat key.json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.dumps(json.load(sys.stdin)))"` and re-pasting.
- ✅ Sync now works end-to-end — 4 images pulled from Inspiration Images folder with thumbnails
- ✅ Home page image grid — fixed `Home.jsx` which had a hardcoded empty `useState([])` and never called the API. Now fetches from `/api/images` on load and renders a CSS columns masonry grid.
- ✅ Persistent volume — attached Railway volume at `/app/data`, updated `app.py` to store `library.db` at `/app/data/library.db` so database survives redeploys.
- ✅ Service account key rotated — old key was briefly visible in chat, revoked and replaced with new key.

### Code / Files Changed
- `backend/app.py` — DB path changed to `/app/data/library.db`, added `os.makedirs('/app/data', exist_ok=True)`
- `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx` — Complete rewrite: fetches images from API, renders masonry grid with CSS columns

### Technical Debt / Notes
- Only 4 test images synced so far — full Inspiration Images folder sync needed on Day 4
- `/api/debug` endpoint still in code — remove before production (Day 13)
- `/api/folders` still hardcoded to return "Inspiration Images" — fine for now, clean up Day 13
- Service account key ID rotated June 26 2026 — new key in place
- Thumbnail size: 200x200px JPEG at 85% quality
- `Home.jsx` currently shows images with no click interaction — detail panel is Day 6

### Starting Point for Day 4
**First task:** Sync the full Inspiration Images folder (go to `/sync`, hit Sync Now — should pull all images, not just the 4 test ones).

**Then:** Begin Day 4 work — tag chip search. This requires:
1. Running the Gemini AI tagging pass on all synced images (Day 3's original goal, deferred)
2. Building tag autocomplete UI in the search bar
3. AND/filter chip logic
4. Live-updating results grid

The tagging pass must happen before search is useful — no tags in DB yet. Budget ~$1 Gemini cost for the full library.

## Day 4 — Gemini Tagging Pipeline + Search Backend
*Completed: June 26, 2026*
*Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETE — one frontend file away from done*

### What We Built
- ✅ Gemini tagging pipeline built and deployed (with checkpoint-per-image logic)
- ✅ SSE progress stream endpoint working
- ✅ Two-ring sync UI (Drive sync ring → Tagging ring) built in `SyncManager.jsx`
- ✅ Fixed Gemini API version issue — switched from `google-generativeai==0.3.0` → `google-genai==1.16.0`
- ✅ 112 images synced from Google Drive, 97 successfully tagged
- ✅ Autocomplete endpoint built (`/api/autocomplete`, frequency-sorted)
- ✅ AND-filter search endpoint built (`/api/search`)

### What's Left
- ❌ `Home.jsx` not deployed — The new Home.jsx (with search bar, autocomplete dropdown, and chip filtering wired to `/api/search`) was written and provided but never committed to GitHub. The live app is still showing the old masonry-only Home page.
- ❌ Search bar, tag chips, and autocomplete are non-functional as a result

### Technical Debt / Notes
- Backend is fully complete for Day 4 scope
- New `Home.jsx` exists in chat output from Day 4 session but was never committed

### Starting Point for Day 5
1. Open GitHub → `frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`
2. Replace with the new `Home.jsx` Claude provided in the Day 4 chat (search bar, autocomplete dropdown, chip filtering wired to `/api/search`)
3. Commit → Railway redeploys → test search bar and chip filtering
4. Once confirmed working, Day 4 is fully complete — proceed to Day 5 scope
